My name is Qiang. I am currently a PhD candidate in the Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies ([TEST](https://nus-test.github.io/)) Lab at National University of Singapore ([NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/)), and fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). 

I am broadly interested in computer security (e.g., CTF, threat intelligence, reverse engineering, and malware detection). More recently, I focus on software testing via fuzzing.
